# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The dataset used contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset is highly imbalanced with the majority of transactions being non-fraudulent.
- Features include anonymized variables (V1–V28) obtained through PCA, as well as `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class` (target).


## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Models Applied

The notebook implements the following models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- (Optional) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) — suggested by the file name

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score (can be added for better assessment)
